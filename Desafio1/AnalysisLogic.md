# Understading the used Analysis Method

Here's a drill-through of what's the method I'm going to use to analyze the following dataset. I'm also using a 4.0 version from GPT to help me understand and do a fully direct analysis.. 

## Headers from IMDB DataSet

### [IMDB Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitshankhdhar/imdb-dataset-of-top-1000-movies-and-tv-shows?resource=download)

* Poster_Link - Link of the poster that imdb using
* Series_Title = Name of the movie
* Released_Year - Year at which that movie released

## Analisys Method

### Descriptive Statistics:

- [x] Calculate mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for numerical columns like IMDB_Rating, Meta_score, No_of_Votes, and Gross.
- [x] For categorical columns like Certificate, Genre, and Director, determine the frequency of each category.


### Visualizations:

- [ ] Histograms for IMDB_Rating, Meta_score, No_of_Votes, and Gross to understand the distribution.
- [ ] Box plots for IMDB_Rating and Meta_score to identify outliers and understand spread.
- [ ] Bar charts for most frequent categories in Certificate, Genre, and Director.
- [ ] Scatter plot between IMDB_Rating and Meta_score to see if there's any correlation between the two scores.

### Temporal Analysis:

- [ ] Analyze the trend of ratings (IMDB_Rating and Meta_score) over the years (Released_Year).

### Genre Analysis:

- [ ] Determine which genres have the highest and lowest average ratings.
- [ ] See if certain genres tend to have more votes or higher gross earnings.

### Directors and Actors Analysis:

- [ ] Identify the most frequent directors and actors in the dataset.
- [ ] Determine which directors and actors are associated with the highest and lowest ratings.

### Correlations:

- [ ] Check for correlation between numerical columns like IMDB_Rating, Meta_score, No_of_Votes, and Gross.
- [ ] Text Analysis (if applicable):

### Outlier Identification:
- [ ] Use descriptive statistics and visualizations to identify and investigate outliers, especially in columns like IMDB_Rating, Meta_score, and Gross.

### UPDATES & IN-FOLLOW UP

### Investigating Correlation Between IMDB Rating and Gross Earnings:

Objective: Understand if highly rated movies also tend to earn more at the box office.

Context: The dataset focuses on the "Top 1000 IMDB Movies by IMDB Rating," implying a rating-based ranking. Investigate how this rating correlates with financial success.

Steps:

Correlation Analysis: Calculate the correlation coefficient between rating and gross to quantify their relationship.
Visualization: Plot a scatter plot of rating vs. gross to visually assess the relationship, patterns, and outliers.
Interpretation:
Strong correlation: Critical acclaim and box office success might be related.
Weak or no correlation: Other factors (e.g., marketing, star power) could influence a movie's earnings more than its rating.
Handling Outliers:

If rating and gross are strongly correlated, outliers in gross might be justified by their ratings.
If correlation is weak, consider analyzing outliers separately to understand the factors behind their high earnings.
Further Analysis Guidance: Depending on the correlation strength, investigate other contributing factors to a movie's success, holding its rating constant.
